                    <p><span></span> "The Idea Jar". We all have those nights where you want to do something, but can't think of where to go/what to do/what restaurant you want to try. As you see new restaurants you want to try/things you'd like to do, you enter them in the Idea Jar for one of those nights. Then when you need it you put in the parameters (i.e. want to go out to eat) and it randomly selects one of your previously entered ideas. </p>

                    <p><span></span>"Guessing Game". Using the data of some api (Movie, Video games, music) we create questions like "What is the name of Jim Carrey's charater in Eternal Sunshine?" and show a list of possible answers from other API queries. Have a user scoreboard to keep track of all users attemps </p>

                    <p><span></span>"Night Out Planner" I was thinking of Michelle's "Idea Jar" project and started thinking of expanding on it a bit by adding some Google API to show info on a place/park/event. Maybe include weather for the event as well? Trying to make a all-round planner of sorts for your night out </p>

                    <p><span></span>"Youtube Content Filter" Essentially what this project could be is a program that would filter out videos that are less relevant using parameters provided by the YouTube API . Likes, dislikes, watch time, subscriber count, etc. - Samuel </p>
